They are available with various features and packages. One can choose appropriate board depending on the need.There are few cases where PRO MINI is chosen over other:Case1:Where system is permanent installation. In permanent applications, the board only needs to be programmed once and that is all. In those cases features provided like USB programmer, I/O connectors and other supporting hardware is useless. The PRO MINI is specifically designed for those systems. This board has only basic hardware just enough for those applications.Case2:For convenience. This board is one of smallest boards of ARDUINO. With its comfort size can be used in mobile applications.Case3:With basic hardware the cost of board is considerable lesser.Case4:With 32Kbytes memory the PRO MINI can accommodate most application programs.How to UseUsing PRO MINI is similar to any other development board. All you need to do is program the controller and provide the appropriate peripheral to get system running. We will discuss the programming of PRO MINI in step by step below.First you need to gets a programmer. As mentioned earlier the PRO MINI does not have an inbuilt programmer, so you cannot connect PRO MINI directly to PC to program it. Choose either UART or SPI programmer. Preferable UART programmer.Download and install ARDUINO IDE software. [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software]List the functions to be performed by PRO MINI.Write the functions as program in IDE. Remember the program is written in ‘C’ language.Connect the programmer and establish a communication between IDE and PRO MINI.Burn the program to PRO MINI through IDE.Disconnect the programmer. Provide the power and attach the necessary peripherals. After reset the control executes the program and provides the desired output.ApplicationsHobby projects.Power supply systems.IoT applications.Display systems.Instrumentation.Arduino Pro Mini Datasheet",

    "description": "Arduino Leonardo is Arduino’s first development board to use one microcontroller with built-in USB. Using the ATmega32U4 as its sole microcontroller allows it to be cheaper and simpler. Also, because the 32U4 is handling the USB directly, code libraries are available which allow the board to emulate a computer keyboard, mouse, and more using the USB-HID protocol!DescriptionLeonardo is an Atmega32u4 based microcontroller board. 20 digital I/O pins (7  PWM out, 12  analog input), 16 MHz crystal oscilator, micro usb socket, power socket, ICSP connector and a reset button on the board.There are everything for the microcontroller to work on the board.connected to a computer via usb,or supplied with an adapter or a battery.Leonardo board is seperated from other boards by using ATmega32u4 microcontroller, Atmega32u4 is able to communicate with a computer directly thus it does not need an USB – Serial converter.Thanks to these features, Leonardo can be introduced to computer as not only virtual COM port but also as peripherals such as console and mouse too.Features:Arduino LeonardoMicrocontroller: ATmega32u4Operating voltage: 5 VSupply voltage (recommended): 7-12 VSupply voltage (limits): 6-20 Vdigital I/O pins: 20PWM pins: 7analog input pins: 12Max DC current for each I/O pins: 40 mADC current for 3.3 V out: 50 mAMax DC current for 3.3 V pin: 1 A (if supplied with an external adapter)Flash memory: 32 kB (ATmega32u4, 4 kB is used by bootloader)SRAM: 2.5 kB (ATmega32u4)EEPROM: 1kB (ATmega32u4)Clock speed: 16 MHzLength: 68.6 mmWidth: 53.4 mmWeight: 20 grProduct content:Arduino LeonardoLeonardo R3 Clone For ArduinoA to B Usb cable",

We sell apre-imaged NOOBS cardon it’s own or you will find it included in ourPi 3 B+ Essentials KitandPi 3 B+ Starter Kit.Faster processing Raspberry Pi 3B+Improved thermals on the Pi 3 B+ means that the CPU on the BCM2837 SoC can now run at 1.4GHz, a 17% increase on the previous Pi 3 model (which ran at 1.2GHz).Video performance on Pi 3 B+ is similar to the previous generation Pi 3, the VideoCore being clocked at 400MHz for video processing and the 3D graphics processor running at 300MHz.Faster wirelessA significant change on the Pi 3 B+ compared to the Pi 3 is the inclusion of a new faster, dual-band wireless chip (CYW43455) with 802.11 b/g/n/ac wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.2.The dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless LAN enables faster networking with less interference (although the higher bandwidth has less range), and the new PCB antenna technology should allow better reception.Bluetooth allows you to use a wireless keyboard/trackpad without extra dongles, keeping things nice and tidy.Faster ethernetThe Pi 3 B+ has significantly faster wired networking, thanks to an upgraded USB/LAN chip, and you should see speeds that are 3-5x faster than on previous models of the Pi, at least 300Mbit/s.GPIO and layoutThe GPIO header remains the same, with 40 pins, as on the previous three models of Pi. However, it should be noted that the new PoE header pins may contact components on the underside of some HATs, like Rainbow HAT. Somestandoffswill prevent any mischief from occurring though!The metal shielding on the wireless circuitry and the SoC may also cause shorts against larger components on the underside of HATs, pHATs, and SHIMs. In the first two cases,standoffswill help again; in the latter, a couple of small pieces of insulating tape or Kapton tape will prevent any shorts.Note that older Pibows will not fit the new Pi 3 B+!Because of changes to some components on the topside of the board, we’ve redesigned ourPibowandPibow Coupécases to ensure they fit snugly.

    "description": "DescriptionThe APM 2.6 is a complete open source autopilot system and the bestselling technology that won the prestigious 2012 Outback Challenge UAV competition. It allows the user to turn any fixed, rotary wing or multirotor vehicle (even cars and boats) into a fully autonomous vehicle; capable of performing programmed GPS missions with waypoints. Available with top or side connectors.This revision of the board has no onboard compass, which is designed for vehicles (especially multicopters and rovers) where the compass should be placed as far from power and motor sources as possible to avoid magnetic interference. (On fixed wing aircraft it’s often easier to mount APM far enough away from the motors and ESCs to avoid magnetic interference, so this is not as critical, but APM 2.6 gives more flexibility in that positioning and is a good choice for them, too). This is designed to be used with the 3DR uBlox GPS with Compass (see option below), so that the GPS/Compass unit can be mounted further from noise sources than APM itself.APM 2.6 requires a GPS unit with an onboard compass for full autonomy.ArduPilot BoardIf you are using APM 2.6 with a GPS module that does not have a compass sensor, you can always use a 3V I2C external compass sensor.Please note that the APM power module/GPS/Telemetry needs to be selected as options if you want to include them with your kit. If the options are not available it is because they are not in stockPowerful Ground Control SoftwareMission PlannerThe downloadable mission planner software is what you use to configure and control your ardupilot board, features include:Point-and-click waypoint entry, using Google Maps.Select mission commands from drop-down menusDownload mission log files and analyze themConfigure APM settings for your airframeInterface with a PC flight simulator to create a full hardware-in-the-loop UAV simulator.See the output from APM’s serial terminalWhat can the APM board control?The ArduPilot Mega board can control Plans, Copters and Rovers. All you need to do is load the appropriate software onto the board with a few clicksArduPilot Mega FirmwareDifference between APM2.5+ and APM2.6Both APM2.5 and APM2.6 are essentially the same board and both run the same software. The only difference is that APM2.6 does not have an onboard compass sensor which makes it more suitable for multicopters. APM 2.5+ includes an onboard compass sensor and can still be used for multicopters, but it better suited to fixed wing aircraft.Features:Arduino Compatible!Can be ordered with top entry pins for attaching connectors vertically, or as side entry pins to slide your connectors in to either end horizontallyIncludes 3-axis gyro, accelerometer and magnetometer, along with a high-performance barometerOnboard 4 MegaByte Dataflash chip for automatic dataloggingOptional off-board GPS, uBlox LEA-6H module with Compass.One of the first open source autopilot systems to use Invensense’s 6 DoF Accelerometer/Gyro MPU-6000.Barometric pressure sensor upgraded to MS5611-01BA03, from Measurement Specialties.Atmel’s ATMEGA2560 and ATMEGA32U-2 chips for processing and usb functions respectively.ResourcesArduPlane manualArduCopter manualArduRover manualMPU-6000, Six-Axis (Gyro + Accelerometer) MEMS MotionTracking.HMC5883L-TR, 3-Axis Digital Compass.MS5611, MEAS High Resolution Altimeter.",

You can check the technical tab for the analysis of input/output range and current draw.To use, connect 6V-23V to the shorter, thicker wires and 5V will be generated on the thinner, longer wires.You’ll get 5V (+-5%) regulated output from 6 – 23VDC input. 3A output current, 5A peak – if you’re trying to draw 3A you’ll need to give it a little more than 6V though, 7V works well.The UBEC has built in filter capacitors on the input and output, but its a switching supply so its a little noisy compared to a linear regulator.",

    "description": "1N4007 1A Diode is a PN junction rectifierdiode. These types ofdiodesallow only the flow of electrical current in one direction only. So, it can be used for the conversion of AC power to DC. 1N 4007 is electrically compatible with other rectifierdiodesand can be used instead of any of thediodebelonging to 1N400X series.1N4007is a rectifierdiode, designed specifically for circuits that need to convert alternating current to direct current. It can pass currents of up to 1 A, and have peak inverse voltage (PIV) rating of 1,000 V.General purpose diodes are two-terminal electronic components that allow current to flow in only one direction, from an anode (+) to a cathode. These simple semiconductors are PN junctions with a positive or P-region with positive ions and a negative or N-region with negative electrons. Applying a forward voltage to the PN junction causes current to flow in only one direction as electrons from the N-region fill “holes” in the P-region. The diodes reverse voltage is the potential barrier that prevents current to flow in the opposite direction, analogous to a pressure rating on a check valve.1N4007 Characteristics :1N4007 1A DiodeMaximum Recurrent Peak Reverse Voltage 1000V.Max RMS Voltage 700V.Maximum DC Blocking Voltage 1000V.Average Forward Current: 1.0A.Peak Forward Surge Current: 30A.Maximum Instantaneous Forward Voltage: 1.0V.Maximum DC Reverse Current At Rated DC Blocking Voltage: 5.0µA @ 25°C.SpecificationsDiode TypeStandard RecoveryRepetitive Reverse Voltage Vrrm Max1kVForward Current If(AV)1AForward Voltage VF Max1.1VReverse Recovery Time trr Max–Forward Surge Current Ifsm Max30AOperating Temperature Range-65°C to +150°CDiode Case StyleDO-41No. of Pins2Diodes — Majju PKDatasheet:-1N4001 – 1N4007 (diodes.com)",

    "description": "Active buzzer 5v is an active buzzer, which basically means that it will buzz at a predefined frequency (2300 ±300 Hz) on its own even when you just apply steady DC power. If you are looking for a buzzer can produce varied tones from an oscillating input signal, then take a look at ourpassive buzzer.Some people prefer to get active buzzers since they can use them with steady DC power but also be able to produce some variety of tones by applying an oscillating signal. Some consider them to be more versatile than their cousin, thepassive buzzer, which is the type that requires an oscillating signal to create any tone.It is possible, and often done, to still create different tones through an active buzzer when you apply an oscillating signal to the buzzer, but the spectrum of possible different tones is very limited and not as crisp or clean of sound as can be produced with apassive buzzer.One advantage to an active buzzer is that you can still produce a sound from the buzzer connected to a microcontroller, such as an Arduino, by just driving a standard high output on the connected pin. The benefits of this are that you don’t need to use processing power, hardware timers, or additional code to produce sound.PRODUCT CONTENTS:1 — Active buzzer (5V)SPECIFICATIONS:Longer pin is the positive pinRated Voltage5 VOperating Voltage4~8 VMax Rated Current≤32 mAMin.

The collector of an n-p-n transistor is made positive with respect to the emitter or negative for a p-n-p transistor.light enters the base region of the phototransistor where it causes whole electron pairs to be generated. This mainly occurs in the reverse biased base-collector junction.hole-electron pairs move under the influence of the electric field and provide the base current, causing electrons to be injected into the emitter.SpecificationMaterial: SiliconReverse Breakdown Voltage: 15 VDCMaximum Working Voltage: 10 VDCDark Current: 0.3 μALight Current: 0.5 – 1 mA",

    "description": "DescriptionThe SGP30 is a very interesting sensor out of the latest generation that gives us information on indoor air quality. Designed for installation in air purification devices and Internet of Things projects. It consists of many metal-oxide measuring elements that the manufacturer calls pixels that are embedded in a single packet called multi-pixel.This sensor measures VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds), which includes all substances that can easily evaporate and directly affect air quality (eg cleaning tools) and CO2. With two of these data, it is possible to precisely determine the air quality. This information is easy to access via I2C communication.The known problem of this type of sensor is its short “life”. Most sensors are designed to be easily and quickly replaced, as they usually last 6 months and in some cases 12 months. This sensor, due to the already mentioned multi-pixel technology, and after 8 years, gives almost the same good results as the first day.",

Gate-protected P-Channel MOSFET (PMOS) transistors are used in the input circuit to provide very-high-input impedance, very-low-input current, and exceptional speed performance. The use of PMOS transistors in the input stage results in common-mode input-voltage capability down to 0.5V below the negative-supply terminal, an important attribute in single-supply applications. A CMOS transistor-pair, capable of swinging the output voltage to within 10mV of either supply-voltage terminal (at very high values of load impedance), is employed as the output circuit. The CA3130 Series circuits operate at supply voltages ranging from 5V to 16V, (±2.5V to ±8V). They can be phase compensated with a single external capacitor, and have terminals for adjustment of offset voltage for applications requiring offset-null capability. Terminal provisions are also made to permit strobing of the output stage.FEATURES:Ideal for Single-Supply ApplicationsCommon-Mode Input-Voltage Range Includes Negative Supply Rail; Input Terminals can be Swung 0.5V Below Negative Supply RailCMOS Output Stage Permits Signal Swing to Either (or both) Supply RailsPb-Free Plus Anneal Available (RoHS Compliant)APPLICATIONS:Ground-Referenced Single Supply AmplifiersFast Sample-Hold AmplifiersLong-Duration Timers/MonostablesHigh-Input-Impedance Comparators (Ideal Interface with Digital CMOS)High-Input-Impedance Wideband AmplifiersVoltage Followers (e.g. Follower for Single-Supply D/A Converter)Voltage Regulators (Permits Control of Output Voltage Down to 0V)Peak DetectorsSingle-Supply Full-Wave Precision RectifiersPhoto-Diode Sensor AmplifiersDatasheet",

    "description": "DESCRIPTIONCD4063B is a 4-bit magnitude comparator designed for use in computer and logic applications that require the comparison of two 4-bit words. This logic circuit determines whether one 4-bit word (Binary or BCD) is “less than”, “equal to”, or “greater than” a second 4-bit word.The CD4063B has eight comparing inputs (A3, B3, through A0, B0), three outputs (A < B, A = B, A > B) and three cascading inputs (A < B, A = B, A > B) that permit systems designers to expand the comparator function to 8, 12, 16 . . . 4N bits. When a single CD4063B is used, the cascading inputs are connected as follows: (A < B) = low, (A = B) = high, (A > B) = low.For words longer than 4 bits, CD4063B devices may be cascaded by connecting the outputs of the less-significant comparator to the corresponding cascading inputs of the more-significant comparator. Cascading inputs (A < B, A = B, and A > B) on the least significant comparator are connected to a low, a high, and a low level, respectively.The CD4063B types are supplied in 16-lead hermetic dual-in-line ceramic packages (F3A suffix), 16-lead dual-in-line plastic packages (E suffix), 16-lead small-outline packages (M, M96, MT and NSR suffixes), and 16-lead thin shrink small-outline packages (PW and PWR suffixes).

It can be mainly found in the circuits in which integrated circuits that require +Vcc and – Vcc are used.IC 79xxIC 79xx is a three pin negative voltage controller IC. It is a small integrated circuit used in a circuit to supply a constant negative input voltage. The number 79 indicates that it is a negative voltage regulator and xx indicates the output voltage of the IC. ‘xx’ can be replaced by the controlled output voltage provided by the regulator, for example, if it is 7905, then the output voltage of the IC is -5 V. Similarly if it is 7912, then output voltage of the IC is -12 volts and so on. The name of the IC may vary based on the manufacturer as LM79xx, L79xx, MC79xx etc.IC 79xx requires heat sink for its safe operation. Heat sink boosts heat dissipation therefore the life of the device can be extended.Pin out Configuration of IC 79xx.The pin out configuration ofIC79xx is shown in the diagram below.The pin 1 acts as the Ground terminal (0V).The pin 2 acts as the input terminal (5V to 24V).The pin 3 acts as the output terminal (constant regulated 5V).",

ARDUINO boards are also developed on this controller because of its features.With program memory of 32 Kbytes ATMEGA328P applications are many.With various POWER SAVING modes it can work on MOBILE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS.With Watchdog timer to reset under error it can be used on systems with minimal human interference.With advanced RISC architecture, the controller executes programs quickly.Also with in chip temperature sensor the controller can be used at extreme temperatures.These all features add together promoting ATMEGA328P further.How to Use ATMEGA328PATMEGA328 is used similar to any other controller. All there to do is programming. Controller simply executes the program provided by us at any instant. Without programming controller simply stays put without doing anything.As said, first we need to program the controller and that is done by writing the appropriate program file in the ATMEGA328P FLASH memory. After dumping this program code, the controller executes this code and provides appropriate response.Entire process ofusing an ATMEGA328Pgoes like this:List the functions to be executed by controller.Write the functions in programming language in IDE programs.You can download the IDE program for free in company websites. IDE program for AVR controllers is ‘ATMEL STUDIO’. Link for ATMEL STUDIO is given below.(Usually Atmel Studio 6.0 for Windows7 [http://atmel-studio.software.informer.com/6.0/],Atmel Studio 7 for Windows10 [https://www.microchip.com/avr-support/atmel-studio-7])ATMEGA328P programming can also be done in ARDUINO IDE.After writing the program, compile it to eliminate errors.Make the IDE generate HEX file for the written program after compiling.This HEX file contains the machine code which should be written in controller flash memory.Choose the programming device (usually SPI programmer made for AVR controllers) which establishes communication between PC and ATMEGA328P. You can also program ATMEGA328P using ARDUINO UNO board.Run the programmer software and choose the appropriate hex file.Burn the HEX file of written program in ATMEGA328P flash memory using this program.Disconnect the programmer, connect the appropriate peripherals for the controller and get the system started.How to Use ATMega328P using ArduinoSinceATmega328Pis used inArduino UnoandArduino nanoboards, you can directly replace the arduino board with ATmega328 chip. For that first you need to install theArduino bootloaderinto the chip (Or you can also buy a chip with bootloader – ATMega328P-PU). This IC with bootloader can be placed on Arduino Uno board and burn the program into it. Once Arduino program is burnt into the IC, it can be removed and used in place of Arduino board, along with a Crystal oscillator and other components as required for the project. Below is thepin mapping between Arduino Uno and ATmega328P chip.ApplicationsThere are hundreds of applications for ATMEGA328P:Used in ARDUINO UNO, ARDUINO NANO and ARDUINO MICRO boards.Industrial control systems.SMPS and Power Regulation systems.Digital data processing.Analog signal measuring and manipulations.Embedded systems like coffee machine, vending machine.Motor control systems.Display units.Peripheral Interface system.ATMega328P Microcontroller Datasheet",

    "description": "DescriptionThe Sensor Shield V5.0 fits Uno, Mega 2560 and similar form-factor Arduino boards and provides a convenient way to interface to sensors and other peripherals such as servo motors.PACKAGE INCLUDES:Sensor Shield V5.0KEY FEATURES OF SENSOR SHIELD V5.0:This shield brings out the standard Arduino I/O pins to headers along with dedicated ground and power pins per I/O to facilitate connecting sensors other devices.The shield also has a number of dedicated connectors that are defined for specific purposes as outlined below, but they can also be considered as general purpose connection points.An auxiliary power connector allows separate power to be supplied to the power pins associated with the D0-D13 pins which is handy for driving servo motors.A remote reset switch is located on the shield for easy access.  It also brings the on-board pin-13 ‘L’ LED up to the shield for easy visibility.Power SystemOne of the benefits of this shield is that it brings each of the standard Arduino I/O pins out to 3-pin headers along with a dedicated Ground and Vcc pin.The VCC pins associated with A0-A5 as well as the misc I/O connectors are all hardwired to the Arduino 5V power.  Sensors generally need as clean of power as possible, so keeping these on the Arduino 5V makes sense.The VCC pins associated with D0-D13 are controlled by theSELjumper.SEL jumper installed= The Arduino 5V power is connected to these pins as well.  This mode facilitates using digital sensors and other low power I/O.SEL jumper removed= The Arduino 5V power is removed and the power for the pins must be supplied by a separate power supply connected to the 2-pos screw terminal.  This is commonly used when servo motors are being driven so that they can be powered from a separate power supply since they exceed the current capability of the built-in 5V and the servo motors create too much electrical noise back into the Arduino electrical system.2-Pos Screw TerminalGND= Ground for separate power supplyVCC= Positive voltage from separate power supply.  Typically 5-6V for servos, but can be other voltage as required by the system.Note:  With the SEL jumper installed, there must not be external power applied to the 2-pos screw terminal or damage may result since it will short the external and on-board power systems together.Digital I/O HeadersThis group of headers simply brings out the D0 thru D13 Digital I/O lines and couples them with a dedicated ground and VCC pin.  The SEL jumper determines the power that is supplied to the VCC pins as noted above.3 x 16 HeaderG= GroundV= Vcc (Source determined by SEL jumper)0 – 13= Digital I/O lines D0 thru D13Also note thatAREFis brought on this line of headers.  AREF is the analog reference voltage for the Arduino ADC.Analog I/O HeadersThis group of headers simply brings out the A0 thru A5 Analog I/O lines and couples them with a dedicated ground and VCC pin.  The analog inputs can also be used as additional digital I/O lines.3 x 6 HeaderG= GroundV= 5VA0-A5= Analog inputs A0 thru A5SD (SD Card Interface)This header provides the three SPI data lines on D11-D13 as well as D10 for an SD Card Select line and power and ground.  Originally designed to interface to SD memory cards but can be used to connect to any SPI device.1×6 HeaderVCC= 5VGND= GroundD11= SPI MOSID10= For use as SD card selectD12= SPI MISOD13= SPI SCKURF01 (Ultrasonic / Ping Interface)This header provides a couple of analog lines which can also be used as digital I/O along with power and ground.  Originally designed for use with some analog output ultrasonic devices, but can also be used with HC-SRF04 and similar digital devices.1×4 HeaderVCC= 5VA0= Analog input 0.  Can also be used as digital I/OA1= Analog input 1.  Can also be used as digital I/OGND= GroundBluetoothThis header provides the RX/TX serial comm lines used to interface to Bluetooth devices.  It also provides both 5V and 3.3V power since some Bluetooth operates at 3.3V levels.  This connector can be used to connect to any serial device.1×6 HeaderVCC= 5VGND= GroundD1= Serial Port RX lineD0= Serial Port TX lineGND= Ground3V3= Arduino 3.3V powerAPC220

serial device.1×6 Female HeaderGND= GroundVCC= 5VN/CD1= Serial Port RX lineD0= Serial Port TX lineN/CIIC (I2C interface)This header simply brings out the A4 and A5 lines which also carry I2C signals along with 5V and ground.1×4 HeaderSCL= A5 / I2C SCLSDA= A4 / I2C SDA‘-‘= Ground‘+’= 5VCOM (Serial Communications Interface)This header simply brings out the serial communication TX and RX lines along with 5V and ground.1×4 HeaderTX= D1 / Serial TX lineRX= D0  / Serial RX line‘-‘= Ground‘+’= 5VLCD SerialThis shrouded header provides D2-D4 along with power and ground for  connecting to a serial LCD display.2×3 HeaderVCC= 5VGND= GroundD2 – D4= Digital I/O pinsLCD ParallelThis shrouded header provides D2-D13 along with power and ground for  connecting to a parallel interfaced LCD display.2×7 HeaderVCC= 5VGND= GroundD2 – D13= Digital I/O pinsOur Evaluation Results:Build quality on these assemblies is reasonable.  Headers are not always fully seated and completely straight but we inspect each one to make sure they are reasonably aligned.We have found some modules on the market that the ground pins on the LCD parallel interface and the SD card interface are not actually connected to ground due to an apparent PCB layout issue.  We inspect for this and correct these if found.  If you are using a shield from another source and have issues with those interfaces, you should double-check the ground connections and if missing you will need to jumper these pins to ground.Before They Are Shipped, These Modules Are:InspectedGround pin connections added if missingPackaged in a resealable ESD bag for protection and easy storage.Notes:NoneTechnical SpecificationsBuilt-in Reset Button1Built-in LED w/ current limiting resistor2  (Pin 13 and Power)Board Dimensions L x W57 x 57mm

    "description": "DescriptionToner Transfer Paper (or “TTP” for short) is the ideal medium for capturing precise laser printer (or photo-copier) output being fused to the paper up at up to 1,200dpi. Toner images print perfectly to the transfer paper because the printer thinks is a regular textured sheet of paper. It readily takes all of the toner the printer can give. The circuit image on the transfer paper is then laid face-down over the copper where heat and pressure are applied making the toner image re-fuse again to the copper.After this re-fusing step, the board is slipped into a water tray where the water soaks into the back of the paper to start dissolving the paper’s Dextrin coating. Dextrin is the coating on the top of the paper that lies between the fibers of the paper and the toner image printed on top.Within a minute of being wet, the paper releases the toner and floats away from the board on its own. At this point the board is rinsed under tap water and dried ready for GreenTRF to seal the toner.",

The A4988 includes a fixed off-time current regulator which has the ability to operate in slow or mixed decay modes.The translator is the key to the easy implementation of the A4988. Simply inputting one pulse on the STEP input drives the motor one microstep. There are no phase sequence tables, high frequency control lines, or complex interfaces to program. The A4988 interface is an ideal fit for applications where a complex microprocessor is unavailable or is overburdened.During stepping operation, the chopping control in the A4988 automatically selects the current decay mode, Slow or Mixed. In Mixed decay mode, the device is set initially to a fast decay for a proportion of the fixed off-time, then to a slow decay for the remainder of the off-time. Mixed decay current control results in reduced audible motor noise, increased step accuracy, and reduced power dissipation.Internal synchronous rectification control circuitry is provided to improve power dissipation during PWM operation. Internal circuit protection includes: thermal shutdown with hysteresis, undervoltage lockout (UVLO), and crossover-current protection. Special power-on sequencing is not required.The A4988 is supplied in a surface mount QFN package (ET), 5 mm × 5 mm, with a nominal overall package height of 0.90 mm and an exposed pad for enhanced thermal dissipation. It is lead (Pb) free (suffix –T), with 100% matte tin plated leadframes.DATASHEETSA4988 DatasheetProduct Summary:Low RDS (ON) outputs<,A0~A5/li>Automatic current decay mode detection / selectionInternal UVLOMixed with slow current decay modesSynchronous rectification for low power dissipationCrossover-current protectionThermal shutdown circuitry3.3 and 5 V compatible logic supplyThermal shutdown circuitryGround Fault CircuitLoad short-circuit protectionOf five optional step mode: full, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16",

    "description": "DESCRIPTIONControl the flow of fluid using the flow of electrons! This liquid valve would make a great addition to your robotic gardening project. There are two 1/2″ (Nominal non-taped National Pipe) outlets. Normally, the valve is closed. When 12VDC is applied to the two terminals, the valve opens and water can push through. The valve has a gasket arrangement inside, so there is a minimum pressure requirement of 0.02 Mpa (3 PSI). Also, liquid can only flow one direction.We tried this solenoid at various DC voltages and found we could actuate it down at 6VDC (although it was a little slower to open). Here is the current draw table for various voltages. We suggest aTIP120orN-Channel power FETwitha 1N4001 kickback diodeto drive this from a microcontroller pin. For a power supply, our9V 1Aor12V 1A power adapterswill do the job.Specifications:Material: metal + plasticVoltage: DC 12VPower consumption: 8WCurrent: 0.6 AInput and output: 1/2 ” (outer diameter)Pressure: 0,02 – 0,8 MpaMaximum fluid temperature: 100 °COperating mode: normally closedValve type: diaphragmApplication:Water, Air, Natural Gas, Low Viscosity Fluid, etc.Package includes:1 x solenoid valve 1/2″",

    "description": "STEPPER MOTOR 5VDC UNIPOLARDescriptionThis is a great first stepper motor, good for small projects and experimenting with steppers.This uni-polar motor has a built in mounting plate with two mounting holes.There are only 32 step (11.25 degree) per revolution, and inside is a 1/16 reduction gear set.(Actually its 1/16.032 but for most purposes 1/16 is a good enough approximation) What this means is that there are really 32*16.032 steps per revolution = 513 steps!The shaft is flattened so its easy to attach stuff to it with a set-screw.A perfect first stepper motor and works well with the Motor Shield for Arduino.The gearing has a few side effects which are important to note.First, you can turn the stepper by hand but not as smoothly as an un-geared stepper.It also means you shouldn’t use interleaved or micro-stepping to control or it will take forever to turn.Instead use single or double stepping.The torque is fairly high but its slower than un-geared steppers – we maxed out at about 80 RPM when powering with 12VDC and about 50 RPM on 9VDC.Specifications STEPPER MOTOR 5VDC UNIPOLARUnipolar stepper with 0.1″ spaced 5-pin cable connector32 steps per revolution1/16.025 geared down reduction5V-12V DC suggested operationWeight: 37 g.Dimensions: 28mm diameter, 20mm tall not including 9mm shaft with 5mm diameter9″ / 23 cm long cableHolding Torque @ 12VDC: 250 gram-force*cm, 25 N*mm/ 3.5 oz-force*inShaft: 5mm diameter flattened",

    "description": "This is a basic RFID tag used for presence sensing, Aceess Control, Contactless transmission of data and supplies energy with no battery needed etc. Operating frequency is 125KHz and Data transfer speed is 106 kbit/s. These tags come with a unique 32-bit ID and are not re-programmable. Card is blank, smooth, and mildly flexible.It is featured with Data integrity of 16 Bit CRC, parity, bit coding bit counting which allows Anti-collision. These cards are typically used in ticketing transaction: <100 ms including backup management.Each RFID Tag comes attached to a small keyring, within a little green housing. This 125KHz RFID Tag makes them easy to distribute while maintaining a fair amount of discretion. Additionally, the process of matching tags to readers is also very simple as well, as all you have to do is tell the RFID Reader that you are adding a token, and then hold the token nearby. Then, when the token passes by the reader, the system can identify and log the ID number and time, or can even open up doors or other access ways automatically.FeaturesContactless transmission of data and supply energy (no battery needed)AnticollisionEEPROM1Kbit, organized in 16 sectors, each district two passwordsUser definable access conditions for each memory blockData retention of 10 years.Write endurance 100 000 cyclesSecurityIndividual key set per sector (per application) to support multi-application with key hierarchyA unique serial number for each deviceTransport key protects access to EEPROM on-chip deliverySpecificationsEM4001 ISO based RFID ICResponse Frequency: 125kHz Carrier2kbps ASKManchester encoding32-bit unique ID64-bit data stream [Header+ID+Data+Parity]Dimensions: 8.5 x 5.4 x 0.8 cmShipping List125khz RFID Card Thin x 1",

    "description": "TILT SENSOR MODULEis a device used for knowing the planar movement. Although they are available in various types their basic function remains the same. Their function is to detect the plane shift from horizontal to vertical and sent of a signal when it happens. There are modules which could sense even small plane shifts but here we are going to discuss about simple contact type TILT SENSOR module. Here we are going to useSW-520D TILT SENSOR MODULE.TILT SENSOR MODULE Pin ConfigurationTILT SENSOR MODULEis three pin devices as shown in figure. All three pins are compulsory for using the module.Pin NameDescriptionGNDConnected to GROUNDVCCConnected to +5VDOOutput of  TILT SENSORTILT SENSOR MODULE Features and SpecificationsSupply voltage: 3.3 V to 5VOutput can directly connected to controllerTTL level outputMaximum output current : 15mACan work on low voltagesMaximum operating temperature: 0°C to + 80°CEasy interfaceLong life.Note:Complete technical information can be found in theSW-520D Tilt Sensor Datasheetlinked at the bottom of this page.Where TILT SENSOR MODULES are Used?Here are few cases whereSW-520D SENSOR MODULEis chosen:Case1:SW-520D is used when the cost of system cannot be high. SW-520D is one of cheapest and robust TILT SENSORS on the market. It is easily available to replace in case of fault.Case2:SW-520D is easy to install in the system. All you need to do is power the module appropriately and take the output correctly.Case3:With very long life this module can be used on permanent installment.Also the module does not need any additional components to install in a system.How to Use SW-520D TILT SENSOR MODULEBefore understanding how to use the module let us first understand theworking of SW-520D tilt switch.For that consider the internal working of this tilt switch.As shown in figure inside SW-520D tilt sensor all we have is two metallic beads. And the output terminals are projected to the inside. When the tilt switch lies horizontally on the plane, the two metallic balls rest on the floor as shown in figure. Under this situation there will no contact between terminals T1 and T2. So T1 and T2 will be open.Now when the tilt sensor changed position from horizontal to vertical, we have something like this.When the tilt switch is moved vertical because of gravity, the metallic balls come to rest on the projected terminals. Because the ball is metallic, when they rest on terminals an electrical contact is formed between two terminals. So in this position T1 and T2 are short circuited.When the tilt switch is moved to horizontal position again, ball leaves the contact to rest on floor as before. With that T1 and T2 contact breaks making them open circuit.SoSW-520Doutput terminals open circuit when the body lies horizontal and is short circuit when body is vertical. Hence using this tilt switch we can detect which plane the body is lying.This tilt switch contact will have noise and cannot be connected to controllers directly. So we will connect thistilt switch to a simple op-amp comparator circuitto make a sensor module.Simplified tilt sensor module is shown in figure. Under normal situations T1 and T2 will be open and the entire VCC appears across it. So voltage at positive terminal ofcomparatorwill be zero. So the output of comparator will be low. At this time LED will be OFF.When the tilt sensor is moved vertical, T1 and T2 will short circuit. At this time entire VCC appears across R3. At this time voltage at positive terminal of comparator will be VCC. With HIGH at positive terminal output of comparator will be HIGH. At this time LED will be ON.This module output can be given to controller or other systems for using appropriately.ApplicationsSecurity systems.Digital camerasToysMotorsRobotic armsVending machines.Measuring instruments.Hobby projects.2D Model and DimensionsAll measurements are given in millimeters.",

There’s a few versions of firmware that you can load onto them, like:The default AI-Thinker firmwareARDUINO. This is a very robust implementation of the Arduino feature set, so you can move Arduino code to a ESP8266!NodeMCU – a very popular firmware that gives pretty much full access to the microcontrollerandwifi functions. Runs “Lua” scripts.MicroPython (stripped down python 3)Official Espressif (the manufacturer of the chipset). They provide anice toolfor flashing the firmware.ESP8266 BASIC.

After you click the “Program” button in Arduino, it will start compiling your program. At this time:press and HOLD your “PRGM” button,tap the “RSET” buttonthen RELEASE the “program” button when the Arduino IDE finishes the compile, and start “programming…”Manually wiring it up can be a PAIN.

Especially nice is that this sensor is in a rugged case with mounting bracket, which makes it way superior to a normal PCB-mounted sensor.While it is not rated as ‘weatherproof’, this sensor would do much better for sensing where there might be wind, rain, zombies, etc. than SHT PCB-breakout sensors, and the i2c interface makes it easier to interface with microcomputers that can’t do the delicate timing of the DHT sensors.Simply connect the red wire to 5V power, black to ground, yellow wire to your i2c data pin, and the white wire to the i2c clock pin. You cannot change the i2c address so only one sensor per i2c bus.

    "description": "This handy coin validator/acceptor module is just like the ones you’ve seen in arcades. This model has the cool ability to accept up to 4 different coins! For example, you can program it for 4 different US coins, or European, or Japanese OR you can have it accept 4 coins from different countries – say a Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, American Quarter and European Euro. First you’ll have to program it with what coins you want it to accept. Any coin from 15mm to 29mm in diameter can be used. Each coin is assigned a number of pulses, so for example, a nickel should be 1 pulse, a dime, 2 pulses, a quarter 5 pulses and a half dollar 10 pulses. When a valid coin is inserted, the output line will pulse for 20-60ms (configurable). The acceptor looks for diameter, thickness, dropping speed, etc to determine if a coin is valid.Comes with the acceptor itself, mounting hardware, and a cable for power/signal. The coin falls through, you choose how and where to store them.To program the validator, go through theinstruction sheet– you’ll need about 20 of each coin to help program the acceptor. After programming, connect a 10K (1K to 100K is fine) pullup resistor from the white wire to your microcontroller’s VCC line (for Arduino, this is a +5V). Insert different coins, and verify that the coin line pulses high for about 40 milliseconds the right number of times.You can download the Electronic Piggy Bank project code fromgithub.Technical DetailsPower requirements: 12VDC (+- 20%)Quiescent current: ~25mAPeak current (for solenoid): 400mAAccepts coins from 15mm to 29mm in diameter, 1.2mm to 3.8mm thickProgrammable for up to four different coinsDoes not work with coins that have ‘holes’ in the center!

It comes with a transmitter and receiver in a single module setup. The transmitter emits a modulated IR signal which is reflected by the object in its field of view or the path and the reflected signal is then collected by the transmitter, providing a digital output to the microcontroller.As we can observe in the block diagram, the technology behind this module uses modulation from the infrared light and the receiver part only detects the infrared light when it collects the correct signal. Hence, cutting down on collecting all the interferences from the nearby surrounding lights.Connections of E18-D80NK with MCU/MPUE18-D80NK IR proximity sensor can be connected to a Microcontroller or a microprocessor easily. The sensor has 3 output wires which can be connected to an MCU/MPU in the way shown in the image below.The Red wire(VCC) is to be connected to the 5V pin of the MCU, the green wire(ground) to the ground terminal, and the yellow wire(Digital output) to the digital pin terminal of the MCUApplications of E18-D80NKHere are some of the applications of the E18-D80NK IR proximity sensor.Collision avoidance robotsMachine automationObject detection",

This sensor is a very popular sensor used in many applications where measuring distance or sensing objects are required. The module has two eyes like projects in the front which forms the Ultrasonic transmitter and Receiver. The sensor works with the simple high school formula thatDistance = Speed × TimeThe Ultrasonic transmitter transmits an ultrasonic wave, this wave travels in air and when it gets objected by any material it gets reflected back toward the sensor this reflected wave is observed by the Ultrasonic receiver module as shown in the picture belowNow, to calculate the distance using the above formulae, we should know the Speed and time. Since we are using the Ultrasonic wave we know the universal speed of US wave at room conditions which is 330m/s. The circuitry inbuilt on the module will calculate the time taken for the US wave to come back and turns on the echo pin high for that same particular amount of time, this way we can also know the time taken. Now simply calculate the distance using a microcontroller or microprocessor.ApplicationsUsed to avoid and detect obstacles with robots like biped robot, obstacle avoider robot, path finding robot etc.Used to measure the distance within a wide range of 2cm to 400cmmaps the objects surrounding the sensor by rotating itDepth of certain places like wells, pitsetc  measured since the waves can penetrate through water",

    "description": "INA219 GY-219This breakout board will solve all your power-monitoring problems.Instead of struggling with two multimeters, you can just use the handy INA219B chip on this breakout to both measure both the high side voltage and DC current draw over I2C with 1% precision.Most current-measuring devices such as our current panel meter are only good for low side measuring.That means that unless you want to get a battery involved, you have to stick the measurement resistor between the target ground and true ground.This can cause problems with circuits since electronics tend to not like it when the ground references change and move with varying current draw.This chip is much smarter – it can handle high side current measuring, up to +26VDC, even though it is powered with 3 or 5V.It will also report back that high side voltage, which is great for tracking battery life or solar panels.A precision amplifier measures the voltage across the 0.1 ohm, 1% sense resistor. Since the amplifier maximum input difference is ±320mV this means it can measure up to ±3.2 Amps.With the internal 12 bit ADC, the resolution at ±3.2A range is 0.8mA. With the internal gain set at the minimum of div8, the max current is ±400mA and the resolution is 0.1mA.Advanced hackers can remove the 0.1 ohm current sense resistor and replace it with their own to change the range (say a 0.01 ohm to measure up 32 Amps with a resolution of 8mA)We include a 6-pin header (so you can easily attach this sensor to a breadboard) as well as a 3.5mm terminal plug so you can easily attach and detach your load.Usage is simple. Power the sensor itself with 3 to 5VDC and connect the two I2C pins up to your microcontroller.Then connect your target power supply to VIN+ and the load to ground to VIN-TECHNICAL DETAILSUses the INA219B chip, see datasheet for detailed specifications0.1 ohm 1% 2W current sense resistorUp to +26V target voltageUp to ±3.2A current measurement, with ±0.8mA resolution0.9″ x 0.8″ PCBThis board/chip uses I2C 7-bit addresses 0x40, 0x41, 0x44, 0x45, selectable with jumpers",

And can be connected to MCU (e.g. 8051).DescriptionThis IR-08H Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module is designed for Arduino used in the model car making. And can be connected to MCU (e.g. 8051).An IR LED transmitter emits IR light, and the object reflects that light. When the transmitted light waves are reflected back by the object, the receiver tube will receive the reflected IR waves.This obstacle sensor consists of an onboard comparator circuitry that does the further processing of the signal.The Green LED indicator shows the working status of the sensor. Whereas the obstacle LED illuminates when any obstacle or hindrance is detected.An Infrared Obstacle Avoidance IR Sensor Module works fine with 3.3 to 5V level microcontrollers.Under the normal condition, the output of the sensor indicates High status.When any hindrance or obstacle is detected, the output digital signal switches to a logic low-level signal.The onboard variable potentiometer helps to fine-adjustment over the range of operation, with the effective distance range in 2cm to 40cm with good anti-jamming capability.When Enable, EN terminal is equal to “1” when the sensor does not work, whereas equal to “0” indicates working.This sensor is perfect for smart car obstacle avoidance, black and white line tracking, anti-drop, product counters, cutting lines, liquid level detection.Moreover, this sensor made with black and white lines tracing the car ran without a black line on white paper, available in concrete.Frequency adjustment potentiometer employed to regulate the carrier frequency of the infrared tube, because the mixing receiver is 38KHZ especially when the carrier frequency is that the most sensitive.The 502 resistors clockwise transferred do ( the launch tube at maximum brightness), then at a white wall tone 103 resistance.

    "description": "Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F Analog Distance 20cm-150cmDescriptionThe Sharp distance sensors are a popular choice for many projects that require accurate distance measurements.This IR sensor is more economical than sonar rangefinders, yet it provides much better performance than other IR alternatives.Interfacing to most microcontrollers is straightforward: the single analog output can be connected to an analog-to-digital converter for taking distance measurements, or the output can be connected to a comparator for threshold detection.The detection range of this version is approximately 20 cm to 150 cm (8″ to 60″).The GP2Y0A02 uses a 3-pin JST PH connector that works with our 3-pin JST PH cables for Sharp distance sensors (not included); the top picture on the right shows a shorter-range Sharp analog distance sensor with one of these cables.These cables have 3-pin JST connectors on one end and are available withpre-crimped male pins,pre-crimped female pins, and withunterminated wireson the other end.It is also possible to solder three wires to the sensor where the connector pins are mounted (see the lower picture to the right).When looking at the back, the three connections from left to right are power, ground, and the output signal.We also carry an assortment ofmounting bracketsdesigned specifically for this sensor.The pictures below show these brackets being used with a shorter-range version of this sensor, which has the same width and height but a shorter depth:Feature summary Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F Analog DistanceOperating voltage: 4.5 V to 5.5 VAverage current consumption: 33 mA (note:this sensor draws current in large, short bursts, and the manufacturer recommends putting a 10 µF capacitor or larger across power and ground close to the sensor to stabilize the power supply line)Distance measuring range: 20 cm to 150 cm (8″ to 60″)Output type: analog voltageOutput voltage differential over distance range: 2.05 V (typical)Update period: 38 ± 10 msSize: 44.5 mm × 18.9 mm × 21.6 mm (1.75″ × 0.75″ × 0.85″)Weight: 5 g (0.18 oz)Linearizing the outputThe relationship between the sensor’s output voltage and the inverse of the measured distance is approximately linear over the sensor’s usable range. TheGP2Y0A02YK datasheet(703k pdf) contains a plot of analog output voltage as a function of the inverse of distance to a reflective object. You can use this plot to convert the sensor output voltage to an approximate distance by constructing a best-fit line that relates the inverse of the output voltage (V) to distance (cm).Alternative Sharp distance sensorsWe have a variety of Sharp distance sensors to choose from.

Use the internal pull-up on your Arduino.Most modern 3D printer firmwares have some sort of auto bed leveling procedure available, but you will need to enable it.You can use this sensor as the z_min_endstop for example, replacing your current end stop. Most firmware will also use the min endstop as a probe, but some allow a separate probe to be defined.This sensor operates at 6-36V, so as the signal voltage is the same as the input voltage, also the signal will be 6-36V.You will need to down-convert the voltage to acceptable level for your electronics.Put a 10K resistor between the black signal line and your 5V electronics input to avoid damage.Drawing",

The LM35 does not require any external calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies of ±1⁄4˚C at room temperature and ±3⁄4˚C over a full −55 to +150˚C temperature range.LM35 datasheetLM35 FeaturesCalibrated directly inoCelsius (Centigrade)Linear + 10.0 mV/oC scale factor0.5oC accuracy guaranteeable (at +25oC)Rated for full −55oto +150oC rangeSuitable for remote applicationsLow cost due to wafer-level trimmingOperates from 4 to 30 voltsLess than 60 µA current drainLow self-heating, 0.08oC in still airNonlinearity only ±1⁄4oC typicalLow impedance output, 0.1 Ω for 1 mA load",

When no pressure is being applied to the FSR its resistance will be larger than 1MΩ. This FSR can sense applied force anywhere in the range of 100g-10kg.Two pins extend from the bottom of the sensor with 0.1″ pitch . There is a peel-and-stick rubber backing on the other side of the sensing area to mount the FSR.These sensors are simple to set up and great for sensing pressure, but they aren’t incredibly accurate.

    "description": "DESCRIPTIONThe mini NFC shield uses the PN532 chip-set (the most popular NFC chip on the market) and is what is embedded in pretty much every phone or device that does NFC.This chipset is very powerful, and can pretty much do it all, such as read and write to tags and cards, communicate with phones (say for payment processing), and ‘act’ like a NFC tag.While the controller has many capabilities, our Arduino library currently only supports reading/writing tags, and does not support phone-to-shield communication, tag emulation (which requires an external ‘secure element’ only available from NXP) or other more advanced features at this time.NFC (Near Field Communications) is a way for two devices very close to each other to communicate. Sort of like a very short range bluetooth that doesn’t require authentication.It is an extension of RFID, so anything you can do with RFID you can do with NFC.Because it can read and write tags, you can always just use this for RFID-tag projects. We carry a few different tags that work great with this chip. It can also work with any other NFC/RFID Type 1 thru 4 tag (and of course all the other NXP MiFare type tags)The mini shield was designed by RF engineers using the best test equipment to create a layout and antenna with 5cm range, the maximum range possible using the 13.56MHz technology.You can easily attach the shield behind a plastic plate with standoffs and still read cards through a (non-metal) barrier.This shield is designed to use I2C or SPI communication protocols.SPI is the default, It is also easy to change the shield over to SPI where you can use any 4 digital pins by shorting two solder jumpers on the top of the PCB. Compatible with any “classic” Arduino – NG, Diecimilla, Duemilanove, UNO – as well as Mega R3 or later. For using the I2C interface with Mega R2 or earlier, two wires must be soldered as the I2C pins are in a different location on earlier Megas.Feature:Small dimension and easy to embed into your projectSupport I2C, SPI and HSU (High Speed UART), easy to change between those modesSupport RFID reading and writing, P2P communication with peers, NFC with Android phoneRFID reader/writer supports:Mifare 1k, 4k, Ultralight, and DesFire cardsISO/IEC 14443-4 cards such as CD97BX, CD light, Desfire, P5CN072 (SMX)Innovision Jewel cards such as IRT5001 card FeliCa cards such as RCS_860 and RCS_854Up to 5cm~7cm reading distanceOn-board level shifter, Standard 5V TTL for I2C and UART, 3.3V TTL SPIArduino compatible, plug in and play with our shieldPackage Included:1PCS*PN532 NFC RFID Module1PCS*2.54mm spacing 4pin Cable1PCS*Mifare One S50 White Card1PCS*Mifare One S50 Key Card1PCS*12P bended male pins",

VT will be set HIGH whenever there is a channel set HIGH.SpecificationFrequency: 315Mhz.Modulation: ASKWorking Voltage: 3-12VDC（Transmitter), 5VDC(Receiver)Receiver Sensibility: -105dbmEmission Distance: 100m in open groundDefault 315Mhz receiver, exchangable with 433Mhz receiver.WarningThis kit is not suitable for data transfer but remote control. Safe for 2 commands/second.Encoding and DecodingThe popular link is like this: MCU -> Encoder -> Transmitter —— Receiver -> Decoder -> MCU, PT2262(Encoder) and PT2272(Decoder) are optional, their existence is to 1)avoid confusing when multiple RF links in range 2) isolate disturbance. You can integrate the encoding and decoding work to the MCUs on both side. Whenever there is no 315Mhz devices around, you may use it as direct cable connection. To setup a PT2272 and PT2262 link, you would need to set PT2262 by a little soldering.",

    "description": "Tri-Axis Gyro L3G4200DDESCRIPTIONA gyroscope is a type of sensor that can sense twisting and turning motions.Often paired with an accelerometer, you can use these to do 3D motion capture and inertial measurement (that is – you can tell how an object is moving!)As these sensors become more popular and easier to manufacture, the prices for them have dropped to the point where you can easily afford a triple-axis gyro! Only a decade ago, this space-tech sensor would have been hundreds of dollars.This breakout board is based around the latest gyro technology,the L3GD20H from STMicro.It’s the upgrade to the L3G4200 (see this app note on what to look for if upgrading an existing design to the L3GD20) with three full axes of sensing.The chip can be set to ±250, ±500, or ±2000 degree-per-second scale for a large range of sensitivity.There’s also built in high and low pass sensing to make data processing easier.The chip supports both I2C and SPI so you can interface with any microcontroller easily.Since this chip is a 3.3V max device, but many of our customers want to use it with an Arduino,we soldered it to a breakout board with level shifting circuitry so you can use the I2C or SPI interface safely using a 5V interface device.We also place a 3.3V regulator on there so you can power it from 5V.Since we expect people will want to attach it firmly to their project, the PCB comes with four 2.1mm mounting holes. Use #2-56 imperial or M2 screws screws.Getting started is easy – simply connect SDA to your Arduino I2C data pin (On the UNO this is A4), SCL to I2C clock (Uno: A5), GND to ground, and Vin to 3 or 5VDC.Then install and run our easy to use Arduino library, which will print out the XYZ sensor data to the serial terminal.Our library also supports SPI on any 4 digital I/O pins, see the example for wiring.Tri-Axis Gyro L3G4200DTECHNICAL DETAILSDimensions (without header):Length:30.65mmWidth:19.11mmHeight:3mmWeight:2.02gThis board/chip uses I2C 7-bit address 0x6B.Datasheets, Fritzing, and EagleCAD PCB files available in the product tutorial",

    "description": "Description:This is a breakout board for the very handy 16-Channel Analog/Digital Multiplexer/Demultiplexer CD74HC4067. This chip is like a rotary switch – it internally routes the common pin (COM in the schematic, SIG on the board) to one of 16 channel pins (CHANxx). It works with both digital and analog signals (the voltage can’t be higher than VCC), and the connections function in either direction. To control it, connect 4 digital outputs to the chip’s address select pins (S0-S3), and send it the binary address of the channel you want (see the datasheet for details). This allows you to connect up to 16 sensors to your system using only 5 pins!Since the mux/demux also works with digital signals, you can use it to pipe TTL-level serial data to or from multiple devices. For example, you could use it to connect the TX pins of 16 devices to one RX pin on your microcontroller. You can then select any one of those 16 devices to listen to. If you want two-way communications, you can add a second board to route your microcontroller’s TX line to 16 device’s RX lines. By using multiple boards, you can create similar arrangements for I2C, SPI, etc.The internal switches are bidirectional, support voltages between ground and VCC, have low “on” resistance and low “off” leakage, and to prevent crosstalk, perform “break-before-make” switching. The board also breaks out the chip’s “enable” pin, which when driven high, will completely disconnect the common pin (all switches “off”).Features:2V to 6V operation“On” resistance: 70 Ohms @ 4.5V6ns break-before-make @ 4.5VWide operating temperature range: -55C to 125C",

The SOP40 package with heatsink on the bottom of the TP4056 and fewer external components make the TP4056 ideal for portable applications. The TP4056 is suitable for USB power and adapter power supplies.Due to the internal PMOSFET architecture and anti-reverse charging path, no external isolation diodes are required.Thermal feedback automatically adjusts the charge current to limit chip temperature during high power operation or high ambient temperature conditions. The charging voltage is fixed at 4.2V, and the charging current can be externally set by a resistor. When the charging current drops to the set value of 1/10 after reaching the final float voltage, the TP4056 will automatically terminate the charging cycle. When the input voltage (AC adapter or USB power) is removed, the TP4056 automatically enters a low current state, reducing the battery leakage current to less than 2uA. The TP4056 can also be placed in shutdown mode when there is a power supply, reducing the supply current to 55uA.Other features of the TP4056 include battery temperature sensing, undervoltage lockout, automatic recharge, LED status pins for charging and termination.Charge module: Linear charging.Current:1A adjustable.Charge precision:1.5%.Input voltage:4.5V-5.5V.Full charge voltage:4.2V ± 1%Led indicator:red is charging Green is full charged.Input interface:micro USB/mini usb/type-c usbWork temperature:-10° to +85°.The battery overcharge protection voltage: 4.28 VBattery overcharge lifting voltage: 4.00 VThe battery discharge protection voltage: 3.0 VBattery discharge termination voltage: 3.2 VBattery: over-current protection current 3 ASpecificationMaximum output current — 1ASupply voltage — 4.5…5.5VOutput voltage — 4.2V",

Create, Build and Run ProjectRefer to the MPLAB X IDE User’s Guide or online help for instructions to install language tools, create or open a project, and configure project properties.Check that the configuration bits in your code match the Recommended Settings below.execute your code in Debug mode, perform a debug run. To execute your code in Non-Debug (release) mode, perform a run. To hold a device in Reset after programming, use the Hold in Reset icon in the toolbar.Recommended SettingsPICkit 4 Interfaces Pinouts** Target device must be running with an oscillator for the debugger to function as a debugger.*** If the device has AVdd and AVss lines, they must be connected for the debugger to operate.Target Circuit Design PrecautionsDo not use pull-ups on PGC/PGD: they will disrupt the voltage levels, since these lines have programmable pull-down resistors in the debugger.Don’t use capacitors on PGC/PGD: they will prevent fast transitions on data and clock lines during programming and debug communications.Do not use capacitors on MCLR: they will prevent fast transitions of VPP. A simple pull-up resistor is generally sufficient.Dont use diodes on PGC/PGD: they will prevent bidirectional communication between the debugger and the target device.Do not exceed recommended cable lengths: Refer to the Hardware Specification of the MPLAB PICkit 4 online help or user’s guide for cable lengths.Development ResourcesPICkit 4 resources official link:http://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails.aspx?partno=pg164140",
